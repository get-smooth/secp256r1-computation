# secp256r1 computation

NOT STABLE YET -- IMPROVEMENTS/TESTS ARE COMING

## Description

This Node.js module generates a precomputation table for the secp256r1 elliptic curve, given a public key point Q. The precomputation table is used to speed up point multiplication operations during ECDSA signing and verification.
